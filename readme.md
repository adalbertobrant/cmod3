## Features

* Play/Stop/Pause/Seek...
* Drag and drop (folders and files)
* Metadata for the current module
* Repeat and shuffle modes
* Classic VU meter
* Keyboard shortcuts: OSX multimedia keys, <space> play/pause, num 1-5
* **Nectarine Radio player built-in!**
* **Browse and download from Modarchive!**

## How does cmod3 work?

cmod3 is entirely written in **Javascript**, works on node-webkit (nwjs) and uses libopenmpt compiled with emscripten plus closure-compiler. The user interface is based on bootstrap and angular is the framework of choice. Despite all that, and after some hard work, it performs really well.

## Things yet to do

* ~~Settings are not being saved yet.~~
* ~~Keyboard shortcuts (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and mediakeys).~~
* ~~Volume control using a GainNode.~~
* ~~Choose a Nectarine stream among a list of streams.~~
* ~~Adding an AnalyserNode could enable VU meter for nectarine.~~
* ~~More playlist features.~~
* Can you draw? An nice app icon is needed.
* Audio is being decoded on the main thread, which is not ideal, it should be done on a background worker/thread (not possible afaik, any idea? Audio Workers issue: <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=469639>).
* New ideas? Open an Issue.
